How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is include files marked for versioning & are ready to be
	commited
	Working directory is just directory in which files are stored
	Repository indicate top level directory & sub-directory including files
	to be versioned

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Staging acts as preparation for commit, which allows m to use what
	should go to the commit, thus enabling me to make sure one commit per
	logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

	When some changes need to be made which is not part of core development
	we can create branch for that, even we can create multiple branch for
	multiple things

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Disgrams will help visual changes happening in the repository, which
	help us to visualise overall changes happening. Usual development
	scenerio is linear (simple), if bug, feature is to be incorporated
	simultaneously visual overview of branches will help a lot.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	New feature which was developed in side branch is now merge in master
	along with its changes. So, now the master has its changes as well as of
	side branch.
