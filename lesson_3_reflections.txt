When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	For remote backups, collabration, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	remote repository might contributed by multiple collabrators, which may have
	changes over the time, which might not be required by us, thus will ensure
	the changes are taken when I'm ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

	clones are full copy of repository, either remote or local
	branch are part of repository, contain all changes before branching, and
	only changes after branching
	forks is github terminology for remote cloning repository on Github server

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	
	Awareness of changes are atking place on remote repository, accordingly
	local changes can modified if neccessary.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

	Without Git or Github the changes needs to be maintained seperately with
	their changes, backup which in turn will require manual merging.
