When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	For remote backups, collabration, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	remote repository might contributed by multiple collabrators, which may have
	changes over the time, which might not be required by us, thus will ensure
	the changes are taken when I'm ready.
