When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
	
	For remote backups, collabration, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	remote repository might contributed by multiple collabrators, which may have
	changes over the time, which might not be required by us, thus will ensure
	the changes are taken when I'm ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

	clones are full copy of repository, either remote or local
	branch are part of repository, contain all changes before branching, and
	only changes after branching
	forks is github terminology for remote cloning repository on Github server
